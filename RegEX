#Regular Expressions
##Formulation of lessons
The formulation of some of the questions can be improved. This could be our contribution to improving the LC lessons.

###Examples for improvement of formulation



##Aditional exercises in the RegEx lesson
*1 To the lesson "extracting a substring in Google Sheets using regex, a nice addition would be guidance how to move an entire 
column of information instead of just one cell at a time.

*2 A general exercise in looking for patterns in a string, that man later can use in the expressions.
